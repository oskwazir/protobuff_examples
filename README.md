# Examples of Protobuff

Don't need to `npm install` anything since the `.proto` file has already been converted to `.js`. I used [google-protobuf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-protobuf) since it made more sense to me than other packages.

See a simple peformance example of serializing/deserialzing JSON vs ProtoBuff (borrowed from the Pluralsight course ["Moving Beyond JSON and XML with Protocol Buffers"](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/protocol-buffers-beyond-json-xml))
```
node perf.js
```
